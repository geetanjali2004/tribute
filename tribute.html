          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>My best friend is The Anjali Mishra. We have been friends for 4 years now and our friendship has been one of the most important and rewarding relationships in my life.
            No,we didn't went to same school or lived nearby but she has always been there for me even when I wasn't there.
            She is understanding and don't mind me if i say that being honest is the worst quality of hers that i admire the most.She isn't sugarcoated and thats what we all look for in our 
            bestfriends,don't we?<br>People say that we look alike,I agree.Friend might be the wrong word we must be soul sisters instead.<br>She is the most hardworking, outgoing, supportive, person 
            I've ever met in my life.She inspires me to do better, to strive hard and achieve my goals.I might stand nowhere but I AM PROUD OF HER!

          <p>Her humurous nature and the girlboss attitude that she posess are my favourite.I like how she handles stuff maturely,I mean most of the times hehe.Even though she has moved out and we don't meet 
            as mucch anymore the bond we share is still the same.I love how she is so beautiful and how perfectly she carries it.
